This corpus was created solely for research purposes by Gigabd research group at the Computer Science and Engineering Department of the University Carlos III of Madrid (Spain)

The corpus consists of 600 texts extracted from Spanish public administration websites. These administrative texts were selected because they are particularly suitable for evaluating plain language principles, due to their frequent use of complex structures, technical jargon, and normative language.

Their inherent challenges make them a valuable testbed for improving clarity and accessibility in both public administration and academic contexts.

The corpus was compiled in November 2023, ensuring a balanced representation of government departments. Care was taken to include diverse content, linguistic styles, and perspectives.
